<h2 id="cyber-risk">Cyber Risk</h2>
<p>The intention of the Security team's Cyber Risk service is to create common risk language and accountabilities for security and privacy risks and deliverables. This includes creating and enforcing security and privacy policy, standards and providing a governance framework to ensure projects and teams align with best practice where applicable. The intention of our risk model is to inform on best practice, enumerate risks, enumerate compensating controls and allow teams to choose their own adventure via risk treatment. This means teams, departments and communities will have autonomy but the Security and Privacy teams need to be stakeholders to help inform risks, threats, vulnerabilities, mitigations and best practice. In our risk model we are here to facilitate, assist, build partnerships, and inform â€” not to block.</p>
