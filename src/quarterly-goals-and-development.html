<h2 id="goals">Quarterly Goals, OKRs and Development</h2>
<p>This information evolves as new initiatives evolve and is subject to (potentially frequent) change.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Quarterly goal should be sized to be executed in roughly 6 weeks.</li>
    <li>Goals will be developed with guidance from the Director taking into account current priorities and needs.</li>
    <li>Goals should be entered in Betterworks and properly aligned with team goals as needed prior to the beginning of the quarter. Exact dates for relevant meetings, dates, etc. will be provided by PM.</li>
    <li>Updates to percentages and comments are to be entered in Betterworks monthly, at a minimum.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to quarterly goals and OKRs, each staff member will have a personal development plan. These are reviewed and updated quarterly. It is the responsibility of each team member to complete these and review with the director of security. The purpose of this development plan is to help inform areas where each team member would like to grow.</p>
