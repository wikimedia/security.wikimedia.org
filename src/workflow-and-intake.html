<h2 id="workflow">Workflow and Intake</h2>
<h3>Consistency</h3>
    <p>Intake channels must flow into the <b>#security-team</b> Phabricator workboard as canonical if they are to be triaged as part of Wikimedia Security Team work. Exceptions such as Privacy Engineering in Asana (and Phab), or #secscrum must be clearly and explicitly defined.
    <p>We need to have anonymous (as in non-community and non-staff) and external user support in limited cases.</p>
    <p>We need to have support for non-Tech users to submit general requests for service.</p>
<h3>Commitment</h3>
    <p>Incoming work that follows a recognized workflow will be (at a minimum) discussed by the Security Team during our team weekly (or the appropriately designated) meeting.</p>
    <p>These meeting may sometimes be delayed or canceled due to travel or other circumstances. The Security Team will do our best to communicate when circumstances result in longer than expected delays.</p>
    <p>The Security Team is a limited component within Wikimedia Foundation and tasks that cannot be resourced or are not part of the team charter will be left with the general #security project attached as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>Ticket status should always be easily discernible by all stakeholders. This includes accurate and current board placement, priority, and privacy settings.</p>
    <p>Team members should update/comment on tickets to which they are assigned monthly (at a minimum) and regardless of progress made. Not meeting this minimum of communication will result in the ticket displaying as "moldy" in the weekly team "Peek" report.</p>
