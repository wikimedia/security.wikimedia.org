<h2 id="fusion-center">Fusion Center</h2>
<p>The Security team Fusion Center provides several functions, including serving as a general intake point for work from all sources. Work comes into the Security team through the Fusion Center through a consistent, and easy-to-use interface.</p>
<p>The Fusion Center also serves as a training ground for new Security team staff or others interested in security, where it is safe to learn a broad range of topics while gaining exposure to the organization. Some types of work will be handled entirely from within the Fusion Center function. Other types of work may be triaged, and if needed, routed through the Security team's Project Management function to the security team's other services.</p>
